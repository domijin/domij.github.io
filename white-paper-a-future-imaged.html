              <li>
                Uncapped productivity for material abundance. Socks for example
              </li>
              <li>
                On-demand: when land in airport, pick up new socks for duration
                of the trip, drop off socks when return
              </li>
              <li>
                Material efficiency: socks are made with dissolving fibers,
                produce on-demand, recycle as needed (like 3D printing &amp;
                material recycle), less shipping/packaging cost
              </li>
              <li>
                Energy efficiency: logistic/inventory cost is building up,
                compared to the scale effect from division of labor &amp; mass
                production efficiency, under global distribution; made in China
                is getting more expensive, and so it will be for made in any
                other emerging market; Amazon will be threaten when new retail
                (self-service store &amp; self-delivery) + local supply made
                cheaper with on-demand manufacturing. I.E. socks printed at
                airport, usb chargers re-engineer/recycle/share, old clothes
                redesign/recycle
              </li>
              <li>
                Customization: design, style, taste is the reflection of
                personality. For socks under the new manufacturing, consumers
                shop design/style in e-marketplace, feed their biometrics to let
                AI adjust to fit, modify color/material, and send to local hub
                for print/assemble/“bake” using 3D printing, robotic arms,
                biological engineering or any other techniques.
              </li>
              <li>Ownership rethink</li>
              <li>
                Benefit of privacy: we can’t share socks or undies for hygiene
                reasons, but more for psychological reasons, which can be solved
                with proper sterilization and psychological “placebos”.
              </li>
              <li>
                Benefit of convenience: my primary reason for having a car is
                the trunk space, to store things that feel needed but not often
                used. It may be replaced with modularized self-walking luggage.
              </li>
              <li>
                Affordability: we rent, when the cost of ownership is too high
                for the usage. But ownership comes with responsibility. We
                provide space, care and proper treatment for pets. Stuffs we
                own, will also occupy space, need regular care and proper
                disposal. Otherwise, the space, material and energy are wasted.
              </li>
              <li>Summarize</li>
              <li>
                Current manufacturing is not energy/material friendly. A lot of
                resources are dissipated/wasted in logistics: inventory,
                shipping, packaging.
              </li>
              <li>
                We can’t find/afford things exactly as we want in the current
                manufacturing model.
              </li>
              <li>Efficiency of logistics come with huge delivery cost.</li>
              <li>
                Hierarchical manufacturing hub that feed on basic materials,
                produce on-demand, recycle as needed, with marketplace for
                designs can maximize the energy utilization and ensure material
                abundance.

              <li>Productivity supplies distribution.</li>
              <li>
                [old age] Autarky, self-sufficient production with limited
                exchange and community market.
              </li>
              <li>
                [past] Electricity lifts off labor-bias with machinery, labor
                cost per production drops and productivity blooms.
              </li>
              <li>
                [now] ICT lifts off information-bias with internet, market grows
                globally and circulation efficiency leaps with e-commerce,
              </li>
              <li>
                [future] AGI will lift off skill-bias, domain knowledge and
                expertise will be less dependent to produce better products and
                services. Any nurse with medical AI can perform high-quality
                diagnosis and treatment plans.
              </li>
              <li>Distribution shapes the socio-economy.</li>
              <li>
                [old age] Reputation. Culture and traditions are conventional
                agreements to regulate individual with the tribe, community or
                society
              </li>
              <li>
                [past] Power. Darwin society with expiration, monopoly and crime
                leads to slavery, militarism, imperialism, Fascist.
              </li>
              <li>
                [now] Network. As peaces continue, social classes consolidates,
                so it is with wealth distribution. Capitalism leaves less
                chances for the resourceless families. It compliments the elites
                in Wall Street and Silicon Valley but many feel anxious about
                the fast-changing job market and heating threats from AI powered
                automations. That’s how I interpret the political shifts due to
                the rising voice from the worried/underappreciated workers.
              </li>
              <li>
                [future] Human first, AI is mimic of human intelligence and the
                unprecedented computational ability should aim to enhance human.
                Let AGI be good at information processing and empower human to
                take responsibility of moral consideration, decision making,
                medical result delivery, providing humanize service and
                creativity. Follow this direction, individuals will no longer be
                bounded with single career/job function, to accumulate
                competitive advantage for financial reward. Income differences
                will also decrease, as personal domain knowledge and expertise
                cannot compete with AGI. Equality will detour individual’s
                interest to creativity, personal development and social good.

                  <li>The diverse possibility is the beauty of future.</li>
                  <li>
                    One man’s expectation can’t and won’t satisfy all. But such
                    imaged future is what my technical roadmap can leads to.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Community Management
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Every social transaction (behavior) satisfies the consented
                    social contract adds personal credibility on his social
                    credit.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Example: when the community agrees on sterilizing all house
                    cats. C tells D that he feels lazy to sterilize his cat and
                    it won’t matter. AGI notices the violation of consented
                    social contract and lower C’s social credit correspondingly
                    to reflect his credibility.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The math behind: enforcement is hard/costly, and legislation
                    is dangerous with central authority.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The average social credit profile of the members represents
                    the credibility of the community, which goes up to higher
                    level of communities like city, state, continent, planet and
                    more.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Unlike black mirror - the future of social media, the
                    enforcement is AGI automated to remove human bias.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Every proposed change of social contract in the community
                    will be voted and adopted automatically, using voice based
                    human-information-interface.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Like-minded people gather to form community, guided by
                    democratically voted social contracts, which are registered
                    as smart contracts on community blockchains.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Example: A tells B that they should sterilize house cats and
                    B agrees to advocate the policy to community. Wearable
                    device with AGI automatically recognize and draft a proposal
                    to the community. A&amp;B discusses about the detail and let
                    AGI make a campaign. Members who see the campaign may
                    express their options, which will be collected and counted.
                    Soon, AGI receives enough feedback and make the agreement as
                    official social contract.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The math behind: AGI can automate and decentralize
                    legislation processes with transparency and efficiency; it
                    is easier to understand legislation in physical world but
                    easier to adopt in virtual world with smart contract on
                    blockchain; one approach is to establish a decentralized
                    identity system to evaluate individual’s social credit from
                    TOC histories. Anyhow, a society with trust is a species
                    will last.
