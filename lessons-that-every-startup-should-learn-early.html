                    <p>These are my notes learned from reading. I would have done many things differently. There is no
                        rush to broadcast one's eager and anxiety at start. The real service and product that may help
                        make a difference is what one should really aim on. </p>
                    <p>I will stop twittering or posting on LinkedIn as there is nothing needs to prove yet. The work
                        will prove the value itself and I can do it, just with a few really good friends who share the
                        same ambition. That's enough to start. Anything add-on will be extra, but it's not the main
                        cause to chase for. </p>

                            the company permanently for the better. If you have to be aggressive about user acquisition
                            when you're small, you'll probably still be aggressive when you're big. If you have to
                            manufacture your own hardware, or use your software on users' behalf, you'll learn things
                            you couldn't have learned otherwise. And most importantly, if you have to work hard to
                            delight users when you only have a handful of them, you'll keep doing it when you have a

                                <li>A Cap is the maximum effective valuation that the owner of the note will pay,
                                    regardless of the valuation of the round in which the note converts</li>
                                <li>a discount defines a lower effective valuation via a percentage off the round

                                <li>Convertible debt may be called at maturity, at which time it must be repaid with
                                    earned interest, although investors are often willing to extend the maturity dates
                                    on notes.</li>

                    </ol>
                    <p>Fundraising Rules to Follow</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Get fundraising over as soon as possible, and get back to building your product and company,
                            but also…</li>
                        <li>Don’t stop raising money too soon. If fundraising is difficult, keep fighting and stay
                            alive.</li>
                        <li>When raising, be “greedy”: breadth-first search weighted by expected value 2. This means
                            talk to as many people as you can, prioritizing the ones that are likely to close.</li>
                        <li>Once someone says yes, don’t delay. Get docs signed and the money in the bank as soon as
                            possible.</li>
                        <li>Always hustle for leads. If you are the hottest deal of the hour, that’s great, but everyone
                            else needs to work like crazy to get angels and other venture investors interested.</li>
                        <li>Never screw anyone over. Hold yourself and others on your team to the highest ethical
                            standards. The Valley is a very small place, and a bad reputation is difficult to repair.
                            Play it straight and you will never regret it. You’ll feel better for it, too.</li>
                        <li>Investors have a lot of different ways to say no. The hardest thing for an entrepreneur is
                            understanding when they are being turned down and being okay with it. PG likes to say, “If
                            the soda is empty, stop making that awful sucking sound with the straw.” But remember that
                            they might be a “yes” another time, so part on the best possible terms.</li>
                        <li>Develop a style that fits you and your company.</li>
                        <li>Stay organized. Co-founders should split tasks where possible. If necessary, use software
                            like Asana to keep track of deals.</li>
                        <li>Have a thick skin but strike the right balance between confidence and humility. And never be
                            arrogant.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>DON’T:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be dishonest in any way</li>
                        <li>Be arrogant or unfriendly</li>
                        <li>Be overly aggressive</li>
                        <li>Seem indecisive – although it is okay to say you don’t know yet.</li>
                        <li>Talk so much they cannot get a word in edgewise</li>
                        <li>Be slow to follow-up or close a deal</li>
                        <li>Break an agreement, verbal or written</li>
                        <li>Create detailed financials</li>
                        <li>Use ridiculous / silly market size numbers without clear justification</li>
                        <li>Claim you know something that you don’t or be afraid to say you don’t know</li>
                        <li>Spend time on the obvious</li>
                        <li>Get caught up in unimportant minutiae – don’t let the meeting get away from you</li>
                        <li>Ask for an NDA</li>
                        <li>Try to play investors off each other when you are not a fundraising ninja</li>
                        <li>Try to negotiate in real-time</li>
                        <li>Over-optimize your valuation or worry too much about dilution</li>
                        <li>Take a “No” personally</li>

                    <ol>

                        <li>Figure out the financial plan. I.e. Do you have enough money in savings, do you have
                            friends/family who can provide seed investment, can you bootstrap, can you reduce your
                            spending and save enough give yourself 6-12 months to work on your idea?</li>
                        <li>Identify a problem that you and your potential teammates are passionate about solving.</li>
                        <li>The least important (but still required) is having an idea on how of how to solve the
                            problem.</li>
